# Session handoff - Devin sole-owner continuation

## Owner request recorded 2026-10-19

Transfer all remaining CajunWebPro work to Devin alone. Start by reviewing and merging completed Codex AND Devin branches into main; then finish the entire 20i and non-20i roadmap, including integration and releases. The authoritative instructions are [docs/DEVIN_FULL_SITE_TAKEOVER.md](docs/DEVIN_FULL_SITE_TAKEOVER.md) and [DEVIN_START_HERE.md](DEVIN_START_HERE.md).

This supersedes old non-20i-only and Codex-only integration/release restrictions. Devin owns shared billing/auth/schema/navigation/installer/CI changes and final delivery, subject to existing tests, review, protections and operation-specific approvals. Other workers must preserve their work and not start overlapping implementation; their external sessions have not been stopped by this document.

## Integrated increments — devin/full-site-integration

Integration branch `devin/full-site-integration` (from main `1067757d`). Merged in dependency order:

- **Mail chain** (`devin/non20i-mail-html-compose` tip `cf837f65`, PRs #161/#189–#195): complete webmail reply/forward on protected copied drafts, receive/send attachments, Sent-folder synchronization, reply-all, folder-scoped browsing, explicit read/unread flag marking, and optional sanitized HTML alternatives on drafts/submissions. All coordinator review findings addressed including PERMANENTFLAGS `\Seen` correctness and marker-1 draft compatibility.

## Starting source and actions taken

Main read before the handoff: `a86f6f4fa592e6f715a9420aec8de4622258642e`. Latest release read: v1.25.0 at `b79c67110829126916e3a65e616191542448bccc`. PR216 is still an open candidate, not a new publication. Refresh all facts at Devin startup.

This session writes the takeover directive and current root/coordination instructions, and updates the assignment issues. These changes are documentation only. No application PR was merged, no PHP/schema/installer/workflow/version file changed, no application acceptance was rerun and no new software release or deployment occurred. No active Devin session or external-worker acknowledgement is claimed. The enclosing commit identifies the instruction revision.

## Devin's first executable milestone

1. Preserve local work; fetch current main, all relevant feature branches and paginated PR/run/review evidence. Check for concurrent writers.
2. Create or inspect a Devin-owned integration branch from current main. Build `docs/DEVIN_INTEGRATION_QUEUE.md` and a stable requirements tracker for the entire project.
3. Identify the first ready merge group across both workers. Fix specific mature blockers, including contacts fixture/payment-link corrections where still applicable. Preserve dependencies and current-main provider/billing hooks. Do not merge all open drafts blindly.
4. Run required combined acceptance/review and normal-merge ready slices into main. Preserve all old source/failed evidence. Continue an independent task while genuinely blocked hosted gates wait.
5. Complete exact-main acceptance and publish the next appropriate verified incremental release, with FULL/COMPLETE/UPDATE assets, migration notes and actual build screenshots. Download and verify every release asset.
6. Continue every remaining 20i and non-20i capability. Do not stop at a plan, one PR or one release, and do not wait on Codex to take action.

## Source and gate caveats

Read the takeover document's PR map. The open catalog/capture family, hosting commercial stack, nameserver/folder/runtime/subdomain/StackCP candidates and Devin mail/project/billing/backup/contact stacks are independent or stacked histories, not one accepted combined release. PR256 is a pure VPS component on an old foundation application tree: never deploy that tree. PR250 is a contacts test correction; PR253 is a payment-link privacy correction. Current acceptance must be checked before carrying forward old failures or old passes.

The prior 497-candidate cleanup disposition is recorded, not a job to restart. Preserve required original catalog/capture/application/release runs. Queue delay alone never authorizes duplicate dispatch or a passing claim.

Do not deploy live, issue real provider writes/charges/refunds/customer mail/SSH, buy resources or overwrite old tags/assets under this handoff. Record exact external prerequisites and continue unblocked implementation. Do not commit secrets or customer data.

Also read [current continuation evidence](docs/ROADMAP_CONTINUATION_2026_10_19.md), [release workflow](docs/RELEASE_WORKFLOW.md), [whole roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md) and [20i requirements](docs/TWENTYI_REQUIREMENTS_EVIDENCE.md). Historical allocations do not override the new owner directive; historical results remain historical.
